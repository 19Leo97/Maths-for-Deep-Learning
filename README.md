# Mathematics for Machine Learning (2024-1) - Project and materials developed

Here you can find materials developed for the course "Mathematics for Machine Learning (2024-1)" at the National University of Colombia. This repository includes solutions to some problems and notebooks from the book "Understanding Deep Learning" (2023) (https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/), as well as a project developed with some classmates, which discusses the theory behind adapting a LLM with human feedback, and an experiment using the DPO algorithm to fine-tune a LLM. Additionally, you will find other extra materials such as an article on the topic, slides, and a video that we present below:
